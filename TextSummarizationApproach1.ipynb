      "In a statement, US Central Command pointed to \"significant secondary explosions\" as evidence of a \"substantial amount of explosive material\" in the vehicle.\n",
      "A US official with knowledge of the operation told CNN Thursday that operatives tracked the car for about eight hours before initiating the strike.\n",

      "Their accounts also prompt doubts over whether the military had sufficient intelligence to launch a strike that, according to family, would ultimately kill three men with visa pathways to the US and seven children aged 15 and under.\n",
