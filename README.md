# TextSummarization

In general there are two types of summarization, abstractive and extractive summarization.

1.Extractive summarization
I will be using an unsupervised learning approach to find the sentences similarity and rank them. 
One benefit of this will be, you donâ€™t need to train and build a model prior start using it for your project.
